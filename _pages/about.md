Hi, My name is Varun. I am currently a Senior Applied Scientist at Alexa Natural Language Understanding (NLU). At Alexa, I broadly work on 

- **NLU Robustness**: How to make sure that Alexa NLU performs consistently under distribution shifts, model retraining, etc. 
- **Data generation/augmentation**: How to generate training data for new features, existing low-resource functionalities. How do we make sure that the generated data is fair? 
- **Data Pipelines**: How to select diverse labeled/unlabeled data for Alexa model training.   

My Amazon related blogs/papers can be found at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/author/varun-kumar)

**Not-So-Distant Past**

I graduated from [University Of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://www.cs.umd.edu) in 2017. At UMD, I primarily worked on the [Human-In-The-Loop topic modeling](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/projects/IIS-1409287.html) project to incorporate non-experts feedback into topic modeling. Before joining UMD, I worked as a software engineer at [Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Research_Development_and_Design_Centre), India for 3.5 years.
