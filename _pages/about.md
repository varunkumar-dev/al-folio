Hi, My name is Varun. I am currently a Senior Applied Scientist at Alexa Natural Language Understanding (NLU) team. I primarily work on model robustness, data augmentation, semi-supervised learning related problems. My Amazon related blogs/papers can be found at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/author/varun-kumar)
website. 

I graduated from [University Of Maryland, College Park (UMD)](https://www.cs.umd.edu) in 2017. At UMD, I primarily worked on Human-In-The-Loop topic modeling project to incorporate non-experts feedback into topic modeling. Before joining UMD, I worked as a software engineer at [Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Research_Development_and_Design_Centre), India for 3.5 years.
