    abstract = "Language model based pre-trained models such as BERT have provided significant gains across different NLP tasks. In this paper, we study different types of transformer based pre-trained models such as auto-regressive models (GPT-2), auto-encoder models (BERT), and seq2seq models (BART) for conditional data augmentation. We show that prepending the class labels to text sequences provides a simple yet effective way to condition the pre-trained models for data augmentation. Additionally, on three classification benchmarks, pre-trained Seq2Seq model outperforms other data augmentation methods in a low-resource setting. Further, we explore how different pre-trained model based data augmentation differs in-terms of data diversity, and how well such methods preserve the class-label information.",

    abstract = "This paper presents a production Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) pipeline based on the student-teacher framework, which leverages millions of unlabeled examples to improve Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. We investigate two questions related to the use of unlabeled data in production SSL context: 1) how to select samples from a huge unlabeled data pool that are beneficial for SSL training, and 2) how does the selected data affect the performance of different state-of-the-art SSL techniques. We compare four widely used SSL techniques, Pseudo-label (PL), Knowledge Distillation (KD), Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and Cross-View Training (CVT) in conjunction with two data selection methods including committee-based selection and submodular optimization based selection. We further examine the benefits and drawbacks of these techniques when applied to intent classification (IC) and named entity recognition (NER) tasks, and provide guidelines specifying when each of these methods might be beneficial to improve large scale NLU systems.",

    abstract = "New conversation topics and functionalities are constantly being added to conversational AI agents like Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri. As data collection and annotation is not scalable and is often costly, only a handful of examples for the new functionalities are available, which results in poor generalization performance. We formulate it as a Few-Shot Integration (FSI) problem where a few examples are used to introduce a new intent. In this paper, we study six feature space data augmentation methods to improve classification performance in FSI setting in combination with both supervised and unsupervised representation learning methods such as BERT. Through realistic experiments on two public conversational datasets, SNIPS, and the Facebook Dialog corpus, we show that data augmentation in feature space provides an effective way to improve intent classification performance in few-shot setting beyond traditional transfer learning approaches. In particular, we show that (a) upsampling in latent space is a competitive baseline for feature space augmentation (b) adding the difference between two examples to a new example is a simple yet effective data augmentation method.",

abstract = {Human-in-the-loop topic modeling allows users to guide the creation of topic models
and to improve model quality without having to be experts in topic modeling algorithms.
Prior work in this area has focused either on algorithmic implementation without understanding
how users actually wish to improve the model or on user needs but without the context
of a fully interactive system. To address this disconnect, we implemented a set of
model refinements requested by users in prior work and conducted a study with twelve
non-expert participants to examine how end users are affected by issues that arise
with a fully interactive, user-centered system. As these issues mirror those identified
in interactive machine learning more broadly, such as unpredictability, latency, and
trust, we also examined interactive machine learning challenges with non-expert end
users through the lens of human-in-the-loop topic modeling. We found that although
users experience unpredictability, their reactions vary from positive to negative,
and, surprisingly, we did not find any cases of distrust, but instead noted instances
where users perhaps trusted the system too much or had too little confidence in themselves.},

abstract = {We explore predictability and control in interactive systems where controls are easy
to validate. Human-in-the-loop techniques allow users to guide unsupervised algorithms
by exposing and supporting interaction with underlying model representations, increasing
transparency and promising fine-grained control. However, these models must balance
user input and the underlying data, meaning they sometimes update slowly, poorly,
or unpredictably---either by not incorporating user input as expected (adherence)
or by making other unexpected changes (instability). While prior work exposes model
internals and supports user feedback, less attention has been paid to users' reactions
when transparent models limit control. Focusing on interactive topic models, we explore
user perceptions of control using a study where 100 participants organize documents
with one of three distinct topic modeling approaches. These approaches incorporate
input differently, resulting in varied adherence, stability, update speeds, and model
quality. Participants disliked slow updates most, followed by lack of adherence. Instability
was polarizing: some participants liked it when it surfaced interesting information,
while others did not. Across modeling approaches, participants differed only in whether
they noticed adherence.},

abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled machines to generate cohesive
open-ended text when prompted with a sequence of words as context. While these models
now empower many downstream applications from conversation bots to automatic storytelling,
they have been shown to generate texts that exhibit social biases. To systematically
study and benchmark social biases in open-ended language generation, we introduce
the Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that
consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five
domains: profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. We also propose
new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender polarity
to measure social biases in open-ended text generation from multiple angles. An examination
of text generated from three popular language models reveals that the majority of
these models exhibit a larger social bias than human-written Wikipedia text across
all domains. With these results we highlight the need to benchmark biases in open-ended
language generation and caution users of language generation models on downstream
tasks to be cognizant of these embedded prejudices.},
